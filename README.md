# personal-site
A ruby on rails application for a personal site.
Developed with the idea that anyone should be able to have a quick easy homepage for themselves with some information about who they are and what they do.

### Bootstrapping

> docker-compose up

It is that easy. More details on how to use docker [here](https://www.docker.com/).

### Configuration

##### Profile Details
All details are loaded through yaml files. The files themselves contain examples already, just gitclone and update the files to your information.

##### Profile image
This can be loaded through a link or stored on the machine you run the application. Just use the yaml for configuration or overwrite the file 'profile.jpg' in the public directory.
